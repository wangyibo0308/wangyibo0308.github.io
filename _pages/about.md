Short Bio
======
---

Yibo Wang is a Ph.D. student in the [FSSL Lab](https://tristartom.github.io/members.html) of Computer Science at Syracuse University advised by [Dr. Yuzhe Tang](https://tristartom.github.io/index.html). He received his B.E. from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and his M.S. in Computer Engineering from Syracuse University. 

His research interest lies in systems security, software engineering, and performance optimization in blockchains and other emerging distributed /decentralized systems. 
 
His dissertation research tackles automatic design-flow discovery (USENIX Security’24), denial of service security (CCS’21, S&P’24), and cost optimization (FSE’21, TSE’23), all in permissionless blockchains, like Ethereum.
